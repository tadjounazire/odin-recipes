    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Did you plan on making stew for dinner but forgot to take the meat out of the freezer? This happens to me all the time, so I developed this recipe using frozen meat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 (1 pound) packages cubed beef stew meat, frozen</li>
        <li>6 medium carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>5 large potatoes, peeled and cut into large cubes</li>
        <li>3 stalks celery, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Pour in oil. Cook onions and garlic in the hot oil until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in wine and continue sauteing until wine has reduced by half, 4 to 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Add beef broth, thyme, parsley, oregano, bay leaf, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Mix in tomato paste. Place frozen meat into the pot and add carrots, potatoes, and celery. Close and lock the lid. Select Meat/Stew function and set timer for 45 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully move the vent to release the remainder of the pressure, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid</li>
        <li>Mix water and cornstarch together in a small bowl and pour slowly into the pot. Press the Saute button and cook stew until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes</li>
    </ol>
